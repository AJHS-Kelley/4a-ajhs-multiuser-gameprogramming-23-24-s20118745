float height
int score
string player name
array pipe heights
pipes have a gap of 60, then 40, 20, 10
jump += height
fall -= height

method jump/fall return height
method randomize pipes height
method take player name, default "Anonymous"
method check if height matches pipe
need variable for next pipe

for loop show nearby pipes
while loop hold game
